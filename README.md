# Design Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Factory Method
The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract Factory 
Is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
